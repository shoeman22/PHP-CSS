Description: PHP CSS is a PHP CSS parser which renders CSS files by parsing a nesting format similar to SASS.  It also lets you use PHP directly within the 
	CSS files for variables, math, or snippet inclusion just as you would if you were in a standard .php file.
Example usage: Take a look at index.php for an example of how to implement and style.pcss for an example of what the new css file format looks like.

The .pcss format:
1) CSS properties MUST end with a ";"
2) Indentation determines parent relationships for rules and properties.
3) The file is rendered as PHP, so you can include whatever PHP you need in there as well.  In the example,
	we're echoing 2 variables from an external file to store header colors.

pcss.includes.php:
If you want to include an external php file you you can do that in the style.pcss file itself (ie: <?php include css_variables.php; ?>), or you can have the class
include it right before rendering .pcss file to keep it external or for inclusion across multiple .pcss files.

Apache notes:
I use this in conjunction with the following Apache directive inside of my VirtualHost directive:
<Directory /var/www/my-project>
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.pcss$ [NC]
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?pcss=$1 [L,QSA]
</Directory>

This let's you setup a page that you can catch any request for a .pcss page and then render it through the index.php page.  You can also just render it in the querystring like:
	<link href="/index.php?pcss=/location/of/pcss/file.pcss" />

Notes:
There aren't any validation checks on $_REQUEST['pcss'], so make sure you validate it yourself.
